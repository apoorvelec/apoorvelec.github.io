<div id="Language_Description">
	<p>This page gives a brief description of the language that is being developed in this project. Refer to this page
		regarding the syntax of the language being developed.
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
			<h2>Language Name:</h2><br />
			<h3>J++</h3>
		</li>

		<li>
			<h2>Syntax</h2><br />
			<ul>
				<li>Primitives: int, double, string, char, short, long, byte, bool</li>
				<li><i>for</i> loop: Exactly the same as in Java. For eg:<br />
					<pre>
					for(int i=0;i<10;i++){
						//statements here
					}
					</pre>
				</li>
				<li>if/else block: Exactly the same as in Java. For eg:<br />
					<pre>
						if(//true or false condition){
							// some statements go here
						}else{
							// another set of statements
						}
					</pre>
				</li>
				<li>Comments: See below example:<br />
					<pre>
						// This is a single line statement
						/*This is a multiline 
						  statement which spans multiple lines.*/
					</pre>
				</li>
				<li>Functions/Methods: Methods will be similar to Java but very simple. They can accept the primitives as their argument (any number of args)
					. They can have a return type(corresponding to each primitive) or if they don't return anything, the return type is void. For eg,<br />
					<pre>
						// This is a method
						int sum(int a, int b){
							return (a+b);
						}
					</pre>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
